The jupyter and .py file run through different versions of gym.
Jupyter will have all the current and future results/plots.
The .py file renders an updated environment using the new version of gym(0.26.1) which will be shown in the final version of the slides, it won't run on older versions. A .mp4 file is in this folder to show a video of the render.
